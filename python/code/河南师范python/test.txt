A lot of people today are animal  rights  advocates.
Some of them are very
Passionate and even quite radical about the issue.
But others argue that ¡°human rights¡± will always
take priority. In fact, in many places even
the most basic human rights are not adequately
Protected. So why animal rights? What do you
think? And why?
